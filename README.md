This project's aim is to allow users to choose what type of menu they wish to add to their application and get the generated XML code for that menu.

Users can choose from 3 different types of menus:

- Options

- Context

- Popup

After choosing the type of menu, you choose the amount of menu items you want to have. Each menu item has the following fields:

- Id

- Icon (make sure to i)ort the asset into your project and reference it correctly)

- Title

When you are done filling out the desired properties for the menu items, press **Generate Menu**

The XML will be rendered to the right in the textbox and you will have the ability to either:

1. Copy the contents and paste them inside your IDE of choice

2. Mail them to be used later (in case you are not on your laptop)
